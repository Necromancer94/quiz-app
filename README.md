# Restaurant app

This is an app for a non-existent restaurant called “Denver’s Special”

You can assign a priority tag, color, due date and emoji to each to-do item.

### Testing notes

* The checkout flow is simple \-\> add items to cart, fill the checkout form and you’ll be assigned a unique order number  
* All cart data is stored locally in your browser, and isn’t sent anywhere  
* There are route guards in place, so the checkout flow and its order is enforced
